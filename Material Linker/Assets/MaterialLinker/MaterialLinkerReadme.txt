Material linker is made to make it easier to create materials and put them on the right objects

to use it, either type a name for the material in the material name slot and press create material,
or select an existing material in the material slot.

add in the texture maps you wish to use in the correct slots and press edit material.

if you now want to apply the material to objects, type a part of the object name in the object tag slot.
if you know press link to objects with tag, the tool will go through the entire assets folder and apply
the material to every PREFAB that contains the object tag in its name
